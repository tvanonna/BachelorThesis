# BachelorThesis
A reporsitory containing the code and raw data used in my Bachelor's Thesis. For more information, please read the thesis. 


## 1 Code

The code for the WebGPU Ising model was created by Johannes Textor and expanded upon by me. The code for the WebGPU CPM was created by Jan Schering from the WebGPU Ising model and further expanded upon by me. 

The included Artistoo files are the edited versions of the Ising model and cell sorting examples from Artistoo, which were used to compare the performance against the WebGPU Ising model and CPM respectively. The original examples were created by the contributors of Artistoo.
